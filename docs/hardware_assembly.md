Now that we're familiar with the hardware on this Qwiic breakout, let's assemble it into a Qwiic circuit and start getting environmental data from the STC31.

## Qwiic Assembly

The Qwiic system allows solderless connections for power and I<sup>2</sup>C so all you need to get up and running is a Qwiic cable and Qwiic compatible development board (or a Qwiic adapter cable). Assemble your Qwiic circuit by connecting the CO2 Sensor - STC31 to your development board with the Qwiic cable and then connecting the development board to your computer over USB like the photo below shows:

## Soldered Assembly

Users who prefer a traditional soldered assembly should solder wires or header pins to the PTH header on the side of the board. If you're not familiar with through-hole soldering or would like a refresher, take a look at our [Through-Hole Soldering Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/5).
