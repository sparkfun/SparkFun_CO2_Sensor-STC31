## Installing the SparkFun STC3x and SHTC3 Arduino Libraries

The SparkFun STC3x Arduino library helps you configure and get CO<sub>2</sub> data from the STC31 sensor. Install the libraries using the Arduino Library Manager tool by searching for "SparkFun STC3x" and "SparkFun SHTC3" and install the latest versions. If you'd prefer to manually install the libraries, you can download them from the GitHub Repository ([STC3x Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_STC3x_Arduino_Library/tree/main) and [SHTC3 Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SHTC3_Arduino_Library)) or you can download a ZIP of the repositories here: [STC3x Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_STC3x_Arduino_Library/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and [SHTC3 Library (ZIP)](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SHTC3_Arduino_Library/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
